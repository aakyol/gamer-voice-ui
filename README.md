# Gamer Voice UI

# What is this?
An app to provide a voice UI for gamers to make gaming life easier. Can think this as a gamer's Jarvis if you will.

# Why you started such a project?
The ability to do commands such as Discord management or hardware info hands-free is something I need. Also, why not have a voice UI to do gamer tasks for you?

# Any problems?
Feel free to inform, will fix it ASAP.
